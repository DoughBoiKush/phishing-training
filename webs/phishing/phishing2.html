    If your account keeps getting locked after you change your password, ANSWERS can tell you what application is still using your old password. Please contact ANSWERS using one of the methods at the bottom of this email.
    </p>

    <p>Hello,</p>

    <p>Your current password will expire in 2 day(s).
    Warning: When your password expires you will no longer be able to log into your computer. Please change it immediately.</p>
    <p>
    In this email:
    -Important steps BEFORE changing your password.
    -How to change your password in Windows/Mac/UNIX.
    -How to change your password if you are accessing the INTRA network via a VPN.
    </p>
    <p>
    [IMPORTANT]
    We recommend that you only change your password while connected to the INTRA by LAN cable. Not doing so increases the chance of syncing problems resulting in account lock outs after changing your password.
    You can also change your password at the IT Support counter on the 9th floor of Crimson House.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please confirm the following BEFORE you commence changing your password:
    </p>
    <p>
    ò That you are connected by LAN cable to the INTRA. Please check to see if you can access RAP.

    <p>
    ò Please use your own computer.
    </p>
    <p>
    ò If you use more than one computer, please change your password on your INTRA mobile computer.
    </p>
    <p>
